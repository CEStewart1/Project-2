## Contributions
As the technical writer, I led the restructuring of the user guide to enhance the efficiency of the device setup process. This involved conducting user research to identify which sections of the original documentation were essential. I reorganized the content into a logical, user-centered flow and revised the language to ensure accessibility for a non-technical audience.

Additionally, I redesigned the guide into a tri-fold Quickstart format, incorporating visuals, icons, and instructional callouts to reduce reliance on text. The finalized guide was produced in both print and digital formats, ensuring convenient access for parents across various platforms.

## Challenges
The challenges that arose during this project included the need to effectively condense the original guide. The initial version was excessively lengthy and lacked approachable language, which required several iterations to identify and refine the components most essential for supporting device setup.

## Results
The Quickstart guide reduced setup time, significantly cut down on parent support requestsl, and gave families the confidence to manage devices independently. By eliminating setup as a barrier, students were able to start assignments faster and stay focused on learning.Â
